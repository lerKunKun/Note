Dear Anthropic Support Team,

I am writing to formally appeal the ban on my account, which I believe was the result of unauthorized activity. This is my first offense, and I want to clarify that the incident was not caused by any intentional misuse on my part.

It appears that my accountâ€™s API credentials were compromised and used without my knowledge or consent. As soon as I became aware of this abnormal activity, I took steps to secure my account and investigate the issue.

I take full responsibility for securing my account and have since updated all security credentials and enabled additional protections to prevent any future misuse.

This account belongs to me personally and has always been used in accordance with your terms of service. I respectfully request a re-evaluation of my account status, as I am fully committed to complying with all platform policies moving forward.

Please let me know if any further information or verification is required from my side. I genuinely hope for the opportunity to continue using your platform.

Thank you for your time and understanding.

Sincerely,  
Runfeng Zhu
